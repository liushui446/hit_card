# ===================================================================================
#  The AS CMake configuration file
#
#             ** File generated automatically, do not modify **
#
#  Usage from an external project:
#    In your CMakeLists.txt, add these lines:
#
#    find_package(AS REQUIRED)
#    include_directories(${AS_INCLUDE_DIRS}) # Not needed for CMake >= 2.8.11
#    target_link_libraries(MY_TARGET_NAME ${AS_LIBS})
#
#    Or you can search for specific AS modules:
#
#    find_package(AS REQUIRED core videoio)
#
#    If the module is found then AS_<MODULE>_FOUND is set to TRUE.
#
#    This file will define the following variables:
#      - AS_LIBS                     : The list of all imported targets for AS modules.
#      - AS_INCLUDE_DIRS             : The AS include directories.
#      - AS_ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL : Minimum required level of Android API.
#      - AS_VERSION                  : The version of this AS build: "@AS_VERSION_PLAIN@"
#      - AS_VERSION_MAJOR            : Major version part of AS_VERSION: "@AS_VERSION_MAJOR@"
#      - AS_VERSION_MINOR            : Minor version part of AS_VERSION: "@AS_VERSION_MINOR@"
#      - AS_VERSION_PATCH            : Patch version part of AS_VERSION: "@AS_VERSION_PATCH@"
#      - AS_VERSION_STATUS           : Development status of this build: "@AS_VERSION_STATUS@"
